# React useEffect Hook Missing Dependency
This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications: a missing dependency in the useEffect hook.

## The Problem
The `MyComponent` component uses the `useEffect` hook to log a message when the `count` state variable exceeds 5. However, it only accounts for the `count` state, and doesn't take into account an external state that may influence it, resulting in unexpected behavior and potential bugs.  This is particularly problematic when the component relies on external data or state that is not explicitly included in the dependency array.

## The Solution
The solution involves adding any external dependencies to the dependency array of `useEffect` hook.  Ensure that all variables and values that the `useEffect` callback function depends on are included in this array to trigger re-evaluation when these values change.
